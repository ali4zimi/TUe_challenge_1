# Challenge 1: Keukenhof Scenary
This project is a visual animation inspired by the stunning landscapes of Keukenhof, 
a world-renowned flower garden in the Netherlands that I had the chance to visit 
last year. Throughout this project, various programming concepts were applied, 
including variables, arrays, loops, and conditions. Users can interact with the 
scene by pausing the animation or printing a snapshot of the current frame as a PDF.

## Features
* Gradient Sky: Smooth transition from blue to yellow, resembling sunrise.
* Glowing Sun: Implemented a sun halo using loops and varying opacity.
* Multiple Flower Fields: Different colored fields add vibrancy to the scene.
* Natural Noise Effect: Added noise to the fields using random generation and 
  Gaussian distribution for a more natural look.
* Street Design: A street with bike lanes on both sides.
* Animated Windmill: The windmill's blades rotate continuously unless paused.
* PDF Export: Capture the scene and save it as a PDF file.
* Pause and Resume Animation: Allows users to freeze and unfreeze the animation.

## Controls
* Press `p` → Pause the animation and save the current scene as output.pdf.
* Press `spacebar` → Toggle between pausing and resuming the animation.

## Requirements
* Processing IDE
* Processing PDF Library (processing.pdf.*)

## How to Run
1. Open the sketch in the Processing IDE.
2. Click Run.
3. Use the controls mentioned above to interact with the animation.
